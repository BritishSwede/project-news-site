# News Site

First individual project for the Technigo boot camp. The assignment was to create a responsive news site using grid and flexbox. 


## The problem

I planned the project by drawing a sketch of what I wanted to do on a piece of paper. After that I researched how to use css grid and flexbox to decide which technique I was going to use. Since this is my first ever coding project I decided to combine the techniques as I believe in learning by doing. 

If I had more time I would have focused more on the design of the project. I would also have looked into adding some animations.
